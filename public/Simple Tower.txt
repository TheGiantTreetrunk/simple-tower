## Bug Fixes
- i fixed the score reset feature. turns out i had two different versions of score for some odd reason...
- Infinity looting and breaking is fixed...

## New Features

### UIX update 
- Instead of receiving alert messages from the web browser, you now get proper pop ups in the UI

### Looting Mechanic V. 1.0

- looting has finally been added. but only if you open the box. im working out a different mechanic if you smash it. im leaning towards either halving what you get or just flat out not give it to you at all
- Based on difficulty 
	- Easy gives you one of each item
	- Medium Doubles
	- Hard adds Russian Roulette where you could either find 10 or nothing... its a gamble...
- Items added for looting
	- Food Heals the player
	- Coins add wealth (future feature being planned to help you spend these coins...)
	- Armor gives extra padding in fights
	- You can now find different weapons throughout the tower, some are good, others not so good....



### The Dark Key...

- I added they key, finally. so now you can enter the top floor. currently i have nothing there but ill be adding a door which takes you to the final boss. when i get them drawn up. i currently have the boss battle mechanic there, i just need to draw them all out...


## Future Updates

- Boss Mechanics, going to be drawn up and implemented.
- Final floor will actually have stuff.
- UIX fixes will be coming / getting overhauled as well.
